The acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness.<br /><br />Diane Keaton portrayed the main character, Patsy McCartle who had two sons whom she adored. Her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen. It was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs.<br /><br />Just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard, but so true. I have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie, from what I remember.<br /><br />I also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. Yet it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them.'\n",

Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car!. The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is.

    "\n",
    "I observe that as the training size increases, the F1 score of the model increases. For example, with only 1000 training samples we can achieve an accuracy of 77.6% while with 5,000 training samples we can achieve a score of 81.8%. This is to be expected because the more training examples we have, the better the predicting capability and generalization to the unseen test the model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also observe that as the training size increases, the rate of gain in F1 of adding on an additional 1000 sample decreased. Simply put the F1 score did not increase linearlly to the size of the Training. There appears to be a log relationship.\n",

    "Between 1000 and 2000 examples, the F score increased 1.65% Between 2000 and 4000 it increased 1.34%. Between 4000 and 8000 it increased 3.15%. Between 8000 and 16000 it increased 1.88%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this observed relationship, I would expect an increase of around 2% for every doubling in training size. Hence, I expect an increase of another 2% to 88% if we add another 25000 examples. (Although this is not guranteed)\n"

    "This was an interesting investigation. We learnt from §5 that as the training size increases, the F-score increases (although non-linearly). In this section, we conducted the same training size variation, but using different levels of features (words) namely features of 100, 1000 and 10000. What I observed was that not only did the F1-score change, but the profile of the training curve also changed with different number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, using only 100 word features, we see that the F1 score at with a training_size of 1000 was the lowest at 69.86%. With 1000 word features, this increased to 77.57% and with 10,000 this climbed to 79.78%. It seems that as the number of word features increase, the F-score also increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this holds less weight when we train with the full training_size of 25000. At 100 word features, the F1 score was 73.22% and at 1000 features increased to 85.95% as expected. However, with 10,000 features, the score actually decreased to 85.52%.This could suggest that there are only a certain number of \"indicator\" words utilized by our model. After around 1000 features, most of the additional features are perhaps not useful to our predictor. In addition having more features could result in overfitting of our model. This means that after training, our model will generalize less well to the unseen test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning curve profile also varied between different feature settings. For instance, with 100 features, the model quickly learnt the most optimal model. After 5000-10000 training examples, the model did not imrpove the score. It suggests that maybe the model learnt the most optimal parameters. Furthurmore, this score actually dropped after 20,000 instances suggesting either overfitting or lack of features to search over since the feature space is so constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 1000 features, the model could continually and gradually improve its score with added training. "

For instance, with a feature size of 300 and window of 30, when the trainSize was increased from 1000 to 25000, the performance of the setting increased from 86% to 88%. What is suprising to me however is the performance with only a training size of 1000. The model could predict quite accuracy with even a small trainingSize of 1000.\n",

For example, when the size was increased from 75 to 300, across all the settings the performance increased. This is probably because with a higher dimension, the word vectors contain a greater featuress that can be used differentiate each other.\n",
