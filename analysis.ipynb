The acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness.<br /><br />Diane Keaton portrayed the main character, Patsy McCartle who had two sons whom she adored. Her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen. It was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs.<br /><br />Just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard, but so true. I have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie, from what I remember.<br /><br />I also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. Yet it was done so well. I applaud the director for making this movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them.'\n",

Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car!. The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is.

    "I observe that our logistic regression model was suprisingly accurate even when training even with a minimal of 1000 samples. It seems that given only 1000 samples, our model could identify the sentiment relatively well\n",
    "\n",
    "I observe that as the training size increases, the F1 score of the model increases. For example, with only 1000 training samples we can achieve an accuracy of 77.6% while with 5,000 training samples we can achieve an accuracy of 81.8%. This is to be expected because the more training examples we have, the better the predicting capability and generalization to the unseen test the model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also observe that as the training size increases, the rate of gain in F1 of adding on an additional 1000 sample decreased. Simply put the F1 score did not increase linearlly to the size of the Training. There appears to be a log relationship.\n",

    "Between 1000 and 2000 examples, the F score increased 1.65% Between 2000 and 4000 it increased 1.34%. Between 4000 and 8000 it increased 3.15%. Between 8000 and 16000 it increased 1.88%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this observed relationship, I would expect an increase of around 2% for every doubling in training size. Hence, I expect an increase of another 2% to 88% if we add another 25000 examples. (Although this is not guranteed)\n"
